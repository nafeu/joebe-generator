Then, one fateful night, my friend asked me: “How would react if THE CYCLE FRONTIER update dropped tomorrow?”. For the rest of the night I was shook. I truly believed that if that update had dropped the next, I would have died of excitement .Not joking. I don’t think my weak body that is not used to work, stress or even sport could have handled the update.I think I would have died of shock or a heart attack if THE CYCLE FRONTIER update came back then. This motivated me. I have a lot of sport since then, started going to bed at reasonable times and waking up in the morning again. I eat healthily now and I have decided to quit university, because I cannot have something in my life that stresses me when the update drops. I think I am ready for THE CYCLE FRONTIER now. Bring it on Mr. Newell. I am ready when you are. Are you ready for THE CYCLE FRONTIER? How long do you think the 3kliksphilips video will be, or rather how many will there be in one month?
